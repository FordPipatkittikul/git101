# Scenario

1) Imagine you are working on a project, and some time ago, you wrote a feature that was later removed or changed. Now, you want to bring back that old feature, but you don’t want to roll back everything—just that specific part.

To do this, we will:

- Find the old commit where the feature existed.
- Create a new branch from that old commit.
- Merge the new branch into our current working branch.
